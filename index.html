                <p style="text-align:justify">Over the past years there has been a rapid growth in the use and the
                    importance
                    of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) along with their application to many important tasks. KGs are large
                    networks of
                    real-world entities described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to each
                    other. On the
                    other hand, Deep Learning methods have also become an important area of research, achieving some
                    important
                    breakthrough in various research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image
                    Recognition.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical
                    that the
                    communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP join their forces in order to
                    develop more
                    effective algorithms and applications.
                    This workshop, in the wake of other similar efforts at previous Semantic Web conferences such as

                <h4>Expediting Next-Generation AI for Health via KG and LLM Co-Learning</h4>
                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                Large language models (LLM) have brought disruptive progress to information technology from accessing data to performing
                analytical tasks. While demonstrating unprecedented capabilities, LLMs have been found unreliable in tasks requiring
                factual knowledge and rigorous reasoning, posing critical challenges in domains such as healthcare. Knowledge graphs (KG)
                have been widely used for explicitly organizing and indexing biomedical knowledge, but the quality and coverage of KG are
                hard to scale up given the notoriously complex and noisy healthcare data with multiple modalities from multiple institutions.
                Existing approaches show promises in combining LLMs and KGs to enhance each other, but they do not study the techniques in
                real healthcare contexts and scenarios. In this talk, I will introduce our research vision and agenda towards KG-LLM co-learning
                for healthcare, followed by success examples from our recent exploration on LLM-aided KG construction, KG-guided LLM enhancement,
                and federated multi-agent systems. I will conclude the talk with discussions on future directions that can benefit from further
                collaborations with researchers interested in data mining or biomedical informatics in general.

                <h5>Bio</h5>
                Carl Yang is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Emory University, jointly appointed at the Department of Biostatistics

                Nursing. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2020, and B.Eng. in Computer
                Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University in 2014. His research interests span graph data mining, applied machine learning,
                knowledge graphs and federated learning, with applications in recommender systems, social networks, neuroscience and healthcare.
                Carl's research results have been published in 150+ peer-reviewed papers in top venues across data mining and biomedical informatics.
                He is also a recipient of the Dissertation Completion Fellowship of UIUC in 2020, the Best Paper Award of ICDM in 2020, the Best
                Paper Award of KDD Health Day in 2022, the Best Paper Award of ML4H in 2022, the Amazon Research Award in 2022, the Microsoft
                Accelerating Foundation Models Research Award in 2023, and multiple Emory internal research awards. Carl's research receives
